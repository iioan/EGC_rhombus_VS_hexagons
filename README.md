## Defender of Diamonds

Welcome to Defender of Diamonds!

This game tests your strategic skills to defend 3 lines of attack against the "evil" hexagons. Use diamond defenders to launch projectiles and eliminate enemies, but be careful with your limited resources!

## How to play

- **Evil Hexagons:** They appear from the right side of the screen and move towards the left on one of the 3 lines. A hexagon reaching the end of a line will cost you a life.
- **Diamond Defender:** Can be placed on any free cell on any line. Launches projectiles that move to the right on that line.
- **Projectiles:** Destroy hexagons after 3 hits.
- **Stars:** Collect them to be able to place diamonds. Each diamond has a specific star cost.
- **Types of Diamonds:** Each diamond can only destroy a certain type of hexagon (identified by color).

## Objectives

- Eliminate all appearing hexagons.
- Do not lose more than 3 lives.
- Collect stars to be able to place diamonds.
- Choose the right diamond to destroy the correct type of hexagon.

## Bonus

- Implement correct cursor position detection even when resizing the window.

## Tips

- Carefully plan the placement of your diamonds.
- Use the right diamonds to eliminate hexagons quickly.
- Collect stars carefully to have enough resources.
- Don't get discouraged if you lose - the game is challenging!

## Have fun!
